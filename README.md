1.downloaded the dataset with three important files such as dim_customers, dim_products and fact_sales 
2.cleaned the data in power query editor and loaded to excel
3.imported the files in MYSQL workbench 
4.performed various explorations and analysis like 
                      database exploration,
                      dimensions exploration,
                      measures exploration,
                      date exploration,
                      magnitude analysis and
                      ranking analysis.
